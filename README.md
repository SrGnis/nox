# Nox

Minecraft mob and difficulty overhaul for Fabric.

Designed with a difficulty of Hard in mind.

In beta.

## Sleep Changes

The size of the box used to detect nearby monsters and prevent sleep has been massively increased.

It spans 101 blocks in width and length, with the center position lying straight on the bed.
There is a minimum upper Y-limit of 20 blocks above the bed position and a minimum lower Y-limit of 20 blocks below the bed position.

The upper Y-limit has to at least go *up* to sea level, and the lower Y-limit has to at least go *down* to sea level.

This means that sky bases will still have to worry about mobs below them on the ground, and cave bases will have to worry about everything above them beneath the surface.

The Glowing status effect is applied to monsters detected by this.

## Misc Changes

### In general..
* Strafing is faster
* Pouncing goes farther and faster
* Melee Goal checks are done more often (barely noticeable)
* (Almost all) Mobs can see through walls
* Target finding is more immediate, no random delay

## Block Breaking Info

Mobs that can mine blocks, only can do so for wooden-level blocks.

Of those blocks, blocks of non-wood material that have a hardness value equal or more than 3 cannot not be mined.

3 or more hardness blocks include, but are not limited to: obsidian, endstone, deepslate, most metal or gem blocks, and their derivatives.

Experimentation is encouraged.
